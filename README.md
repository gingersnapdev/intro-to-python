basic introduction to python syntax

i wrote this cause my friend austin wanted to get a python job but didnt know python

this is a python tutorial for people who know how to program in other languages but dont know python syntax

this is also written in normal-people words so its easier to understand
i hate it when im reading documentation and its all just words that legit only developers know
i have to spend too much time googling some weird tech word to understand an article
halfway through i get mad and go read some other article

anyways here's a tutorial on python syntax written for people who arent complete fucking nerds
