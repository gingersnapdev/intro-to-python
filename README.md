# intro-to-python

basic introduction to python syntax

i wrote this cause my friend austin wanted to get a python job but didnt know python

this is a python tutorial for people who know how to program in other languages but dont know python syntax

this is also written in normal-people words so its easier to understand

if you're coming here from linkedin or a job application i sent out somewhere

hello

i am not the happy person that's smiling in that linkedin photo

im angry

im tired

but there's genuinely nothing i love more than sitting on vscode all day (that's not a joke)

please hire me

anyways here's a tutorial on python syntax written for people who arent complete fucking nerds
